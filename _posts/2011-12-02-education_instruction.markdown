My Masters of Science thesis project in Nutrition for Wellness focused on developing and instructing early childhood cooking classes. I learned through this experience that sharing the joy of cooking with others is my specialty. I have since gained additional experience designing and conducting kitchen classes for a variety of populations and currently provide group classes as well as individual instruction for all age groups and skill levels. Students can expect to be guided through all aspects of the lesson to ensure they develop their personal interests and skills. I consistently model respect and curiosity for learning so that students are encouraged and empowered to succeed.


Whether you are starting from scratch or hoping to build on your current culinary knowledge, I help clients sharpen the culinary skills they need to support their health through delicious home-cooked meals. In addition to offering group classes for continuous education or special events, I also mentor individual students to help them discover new recipes, perfect technique, and establish sustainable cooking routines. While I focus on dishes that use fresh and seasonal produce, my client-centered approach allows each customer to choose meal plans and foods that support their unique health and wellness goals.


Instruction can be provided within the convenience of your own kitchen or at a cooking venue of your choice. The instructor will provide any supplemental equipment necessary for an exceptional culinary experience.
