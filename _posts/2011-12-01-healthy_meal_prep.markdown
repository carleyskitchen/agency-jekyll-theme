Yes, it’s true, I love to eat healthy. While completing my Masters of Science in Nutrition for Wellness, I centered my education around how to promote health through preparing fresh, seasonal produce. But as a chef, health is an inspiration rather than a restriction. My passion for creating food derives from the ability to take fresh, seasonal, and local ingredients and combine them in innovative and novel ways. Using quality ingredients with a focus on taste and unique preparation transforms the fruits and veggies you know and love into plant-powered masterpieces accented with worldly flavors.

I believe that food is the foundation of health and wellness, and thus am honored to have the opportunity to cook for my clients and their loved ones. Whether you are seeking the perfect meal for a special occasion or a break from the burden of cooking regularly for your family, Carley’s Kitchen is here to help! I also offer meal planning and preparation services. I work closely with clients to design custom weekly meal plans that support all your nutritional needs. Food can be made fresh and pre-packed so you are prepared and properly energized for the work week.

Creating incredible food to share with others is my greatest passion. Reach out today to let me know how I can cook for you!
