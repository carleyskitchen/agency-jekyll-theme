<h3>An Introduction to Food as Medicine
Informational Menu</h3>

<p>Probiotics are an essential component of maintaining a healthy body. Our bodies actually contain more microbial than human cells, with bacteria outnumbering human cells 10 to 1! The bacteria that naturally reside in us perform a variety of essential functions in the body. They ensure the proliferation of healthy gut bacteria by keeping undesirable yeast, fungus, and foreign intruders at bay, metabolize vitamins B and K as well as fatty acids, maintain a healthy immune system, facilitate digestion and nutrient absorption, and protect the lining of the GI tract. These symbiotic organisms are a cornerstone of human health and allow us to live long, healthy lives by minimizing the incidence of disease and chronic conditions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our modern diet and exposure to a variety of environmental toxins often damages and diminishes our gut flora. Many drugstores and health retailers sell a variety of probiotics in pill or liquid form, however their potency varies significantly and often diminishes drastically while sitting on the shelf. Thus, despite their expense, these products are often ineffective at encouraging the growth of healthy bacteria in the GI tract.</p>

<p>So how can you get these beneficial bacterial buddies back in your belly where they belong? By consuming delicious Carleyâ€™s Kitchen Cultured Products!</p>

<p>These homemade probiotics are organic, raw, and made in small batches to ensure potency and quality. Each food has unique medicinal benefits and is a delicious addition to any meal or snack! They also serve as healthy alternatives to traditional snack foods, and often help minimize cravings for less-nutritious foods. Ingredients are organic, local, fresh, and seasonal whenever possible.</p>
