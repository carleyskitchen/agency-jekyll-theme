<h3>Personalized Plant-Based Grab and Go Meals</h3>

<p>Seasonal, local, organic, plant-based meals</p>

<p>All meals are made in-house and packed for convenience so clients have a full fridge waiting for them when they get home, or a convenient means of bringing their food with them wherever they go throughout the week.</p>

<p>Each meal plan includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Each meal is fully prepared, individually packaged, and ready to enjoy.</p>

<p>Each meal plan is unique to the individual. Through a brief and convenient initial consultation, your personal chef will develop a meal plan that includes whatever you like to eat and best-suits your lifestyle.</p>
